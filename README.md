## Installation üì¶

-   **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dbabalola600/lifted-commerce.git
    cd lifted-commerce
    ```

-   **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

-   **Run the Development Server:** üöÄ

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    ```

    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port as indicated by Vite).

## Usage üñ•Ô∏è

Once the development server is running, you can interact with the Lifted Horizon application through your web browser.

**Browsing Products:**
The landing page displays a grid of featured products. You can switch between grid and list views, filter products by category, and sort them by name, price, or rating using the controls above the product display.

**Searching for Products:**
Use the integrated search bar to find specific products. You can type keywords and select a category for a more refined search. The search bar also provides popular search suggestions when focused.

**Adding to Cart:**
Click the "Add to Cart" button on any product card to add items to your shopping cart. The cart icon in the header will dynamically update with the total number of items. Click the floating cart button at the bottom right of the screen to view and manage your cart.

**Managing Your Cart:**
Inside the cart sidebar, you have full control: easily adjust the quantity of each item using the increment/decrement buttons or remove items entirely from your cart. The total price will update dynamically as you make changes.

**User Authentication:**
Click "Sign In" or "Sign Up" in the header to open the authentication modal. New users can register, and existing users can log in (a mock authentication system is implemented for frontend demonstration purposes).

**Product Favorites:**
Click the heart icon on any product card to effortlessly add or remove it from your personal favorites list.
