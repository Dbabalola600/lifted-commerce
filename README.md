cd lifted-commerce
```

üì¶ **Install Dependencies**:
```bash

### Environment Variables
This project does not require any specific environment variables as it is a pure frontend application and relies on mocked data.

## Usage

Once the project dependencies are installed, you can start the development server or build the application for production.

üöÄ **Start the Development Server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This command will open the application in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173`. The development server supports hot module replacement for a smooth development workflow.
